## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repository is pre-configured for GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to publish it:

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and ensure **Build and deployment** is set to **GitHub Actions** (the default when using the provided workflow).
3. A workflow named **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will build the Vite app and publish the `dist` folder to Pages.
4. The workflow automatically sets the correct base path for both classic project pages (`https://github.io/<repo>/`) and user/organization pages (`https://<user>.github.io/`).

### Customization tips

- If you use a custom domain, set `VITE_BASE_PATH=/` as a repository secret or in the Pages workflow to match your root path.
- For deployments outside GitHub Pages, you can override the base path locally by exporting `VITE_BASE_PATH` before running `npm run build`.
